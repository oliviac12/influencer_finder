Hey,\r\n\r\njelly beans, this is your captain speaking.\r\n\r\nWelcome to Naughty Boy Yacht Club.\r\n\r\nGo ahead and share this video to the group chat.\r\n\r\nLet me show you how it works.\r\n\r\nThe boat pickup location is super convenient in Navy Yard.\r\n\r\nYou can bring anywhere from 10 to 12 people.\r\n\r\nLet me tell you, this boat. Oh.\r\n\r\nIs 45 feet of luxury. It was so gorgeous.\r\n\r\nI felt like I was in a Beyonce video.\r\n\r\nYou can make your own playlist and they be jamming. Y'all.\r\n\r\nThat sound system is amazing.\r\n\r\nAll of your breakfast food and bottomless mimosas are included\r\n\r\nwith the price. Those waffles are freshly made.\r\n\r\nBefore you set sail, you can eat and drink to your heart's desire.\r\n\r\nY'all, the mimosas hit,\r\n\r\nand then Sunday fun day was fully activated.\r\n\r\nBonus points because this is a black owned,\r\n\r\nfamily owned company. Not only were they professional and kept us safe,\r\n\r\nhey turned up with us.\r\n\r\nNow y'all know I keep it real with y'all in my reviews.\r\n\r\nThis was a fantastic experience.\r\n\r\nYou need to get your ass on this boat this summer.\r\n\r\nCheck my caption for a discount code.\r\n\r\nWhether you live in DC or you're just visiting,\r\n\r\nyou and your crew need to be part of the Naughty Boy Yacht Club.
